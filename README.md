# Snake-Hardwired


I used The Coding Train's video on creating a snake game as a base. I then hardcoded in rules for my
snake to follow to get the best score. The first being the least efficient and the third being the most.
This will be used in my capstone presentation to demonstrate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence
and machine learning in a variety of scenarios.

To switch between methods, go to line 73 in snake.js and change the number in the function to be either
1, 2, or 3.



Here is The Coding Train's video on creating Snake in p5.
